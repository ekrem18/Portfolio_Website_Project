            The backend and frontend parts of this project have been developed
            by me and the project can be described as an admin panel intended
            for e-commerce use. It is built upon 8 different models. As a
            seller, you can create an account, make purchases and sales from
            registered companies, brands, and products. You can also have
            real-time visibility into stock tracking. JWT is used for
            encryption. A permission system is established for
            editing/changing something about system. Logging is implemented.
            If you want to read the API documentation and check the structure,
            Swagger and Redoc documents are also available. To access them, you
            can follow the '/redoc' or '/swagger' routes. The profit and loss
            statement seen on the homepage dynamically changes based on the
            current information received from the backend, and it is not static.
            The logo has been designed by me using Photoshop.
