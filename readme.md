<p> The 8-bit aesthetic had been on my mind for a while, and I decided to integrate it into my portfolio project. To stay true to the theme, everything needed to be simpleâ€”the colors retro-inspired, and the graphics, cursor, and fonts all had to match the theme. Ultimately, I achieved this result. I created some of the 8-bit images using AI, and I designed the rest myself. I hope you like it! </p>
